You inherit a farm in Kentucky; a long ways from Louisville, as it turns out. You soon find out that interesting people and creatures from all over come to the farm. One night you are struck with a propsition: "Do what the old tenats did, or suffer the consequences." Needless to say, you immediately decide to open another compartment to the shop and offer goods sold from your farm.
