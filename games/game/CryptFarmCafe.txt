Crypt-Farm
-------------------------------------------------
You inherit a farm in Kentucky; a long ways from Louisville, as it turns out. You soon find out that interesting people and creatures from all over come to the farm. One night you are struck with a propsition: "Do what the old tenats did, or suffer the consequences." Needless to say, you immediately decide to open another compartment to the shop and offer goods sold from your farm.

TODO:
	=> Fix BinarySubmitButton
	=> DisplayManager's not showing the SelectedTheme AT ALL. It still shows the placeholder of {SELECTEDTHEME} even if a theme is chosen. (I fixed this but I gotta do it again.) DONE
	=> UI Fixes
	=> Fail EndState is being set to active when FailWordCompletion is true and when the player clicks "QUIT" the EndState GameObject is still set to Active and doesn't deactivate.
	=> When WordIsComplete is called it doesn't set WordCompleted to true.


Just need to fix the overall loop and then I can add in playerprefs.
8:52 AM I sleep now, I dream of Apollo and Eros. Probably Hypnos too. Who knows, working on a lot of things to stave off the depression and boredom.


Hey guys! It's nice to meet y'all. I'm from Louisville, Kentucky. I'm a Game Designer and a writer mostly, though my ADHD has me dipping my brain in quite a lot of technical interests. So, I can be a bit all over the place sometimes. I used to make interactive learning simulations for nearly a couple of years. I'm super thrilled to see to see this initiative take off.
