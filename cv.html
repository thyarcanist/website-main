                • Conceived and crafted the narrative for a horror-themed FPS, Point-Click Hybrid game set in Italy, drawing from my own original IP (working title: Terminus Projects). This involved designing compelling character arcs and storylines, and adeptly localizing the narrative and cultural elements for an Italian context.<br />
                • Designed NPC behaviors and interaction scripts to heighten the player's immersion in the story and the game world.<br />
                • Conceptualized and designed gameplay mechanics like stealth and exploration to enhance player engagement and build tension.<br />
                • Engaged in co-design sessions for the creation of a responsive story system that adapts to player choices and actions, contributing to a unique and personalized player experience.<br />
                • Guided the development process through collaborative development sessions to ensure all aspects were aligned with the narrative intent and vision of my original IP.
