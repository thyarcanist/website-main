<h2>My Neurodivergency in the Workplace</h2>

<h4 class="dateline">May 2023</h4>

<div id="post">
  <p>Recently, I had read an company article that Ubisoft posted about Neurodivergency in the workplace, which lead me to this article: <a href= "https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4MdbqYqnJ4Mk2PGD5hjdYf/gdc-2023-unlocking-the-power-of-neurodiversity-in-game-development">GDC 2023: Unlocking the Power of Neurodiversity in Game Development</a>. And the GDC talk itself, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7547aZkDzY">What Being Neurodivergent Means in Game Development</a>. That had me thinking, I related a lot to the anecdotes mentioned in the article. I have ADHD among other things, disclosing it feels like a Stigmata because the way its treated is rather polarizing. When it comes to behavioral interviews, I'd have to disclose it which I feel negatively affects me. My ADHD is officially diagnosed but still mostly untreated as I still need to find the right things to help me; as it's untreated it makes things like my anxiety and other such go up more than it ever does.'</p>

  <p>I have a tendacy to hyperfocus on a problem and I like to know the reason scour everything about why something works because it will allow me to figure out other possible solutions. I've been channeling my tendancies to hyperfocus from a challenge into an advantage in a professional setting. Which may cause me to lose track of time, but the end result, is work it. Due to this, even on my odd-seeming portfolio, I've done a deep-dive in Game Design: finding my areas of enjoyment to be systeming, balancing and the more data-centric parts of it. With that in mind, when that happens: the best thing you can ask is, what did you discover?</p>
  
  <p>Even more so, now with ChatGPT being a thing. I write in a way that may make it seem like it's written using ChatGPT, though it's mostly because due to my neurodivergency: I'll tell a fun-fact about myself, I was reading at a college lexile level when I was in third grade. That got me in trouble because of the subject matter of what I read as a third grader in Elementary School. I've always enjoyed writing and I'm rather enthused by using big words from time-to-time as it comes neutral and well, I'm a bit of a romantic when it comes to floral descriptions.'</p>

  <p>On another note, I have an auditory proccessing delay as it's apart of ADHD. My preferred method of communication is writing but with preparation I'm perfectly fine speaking. Why would I mention this? It takes a moment from my brain to translates the word to say the correct thing, I already have an intended topic or point to make. And if you are an possible employer, bring this up: I do have quite the experience to mention about this&#8212; if you care about embracing neurodivergency.</p>

  <p>Everyone's brand of neurodivergency is different but what about accomodations?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lessen distractions&#8212; keep things short and to the point, concise. Avoid jargon and be straight to the point.</li>
        <li>Record Meetings&#8212; even recording the meeting and going back and transcribing and making an associated document that highlights key information and details helps everyone involved.</li>
        <li>Lessen the need for masking&#8212; a big one! However, this is one such accomodation that requires working towards.
        <li>Don't push boundaries unless you absolutely need too.</li>
      </ul>


    <h4>Scenarios</h4>
  <p>So, then what that in mind, What exactly keeps me energized when working and lowers the risk of burning out?</p>
    <ul>
        <p>Perfect Accomodation seems like: Most Energized</p>
        <li>Small to medium-sized team that I mainly work with, fridays are off unless otherwise needed to allow for appointments. I am able to mentor someone once I'm perfectly up to speed with how the process works. Focus time for researching and strategizing. Working fully remotely, with the ability to go into the office occassionally as I wish.</li>
        <p>Good Accomodation seems like: Moderately Energized</p>
        <li>Small to medium-sized team, flexibility when I work with known unchanging core hours when working.</li>
        <p>Decent Accomodation seems like: Ok</p>
        <li>Small to medium-sized team, fridays are off unless otherwise needed to allow for appointments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Bad Accomodation is simply no accomodation. </p>
