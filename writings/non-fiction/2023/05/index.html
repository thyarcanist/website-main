<h2>My Neurodivergency in the Workplace</h2>

<h4 class="dateline">May 2023</h4>

<div id="post">
  <p>Recently, I had read an company article that Ubisoft posted about Neurodivergency in the workplace, which lead me to this article: <a href= "https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4MdbqYqnJ4Mk2PGD5hjdYf/gdc-2023-unlocking-the-power-of-neurodiversity-in-game-development">GDC 2023: Unlocking the Power of Neurodiversity in Game Development</a>. And the GDC talk itself, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7547aZkDzY">What Being Neurodivergent Means in Game Development</a>. That had me thinking, I related a lot to the anecdotes mentioned in the article. I have ADHD among other things, disclosing it feels like a Stigmata because the way its treated is rather polarizing. <br> </p>
    
     <p>When it comes to behavioral interviews, I'd have to disclose it which I feel negatively affects me. My ADHD is officially diagnosed but still mostly untreated as I still need to find the right things to help me; as it's untreated it makes things like my anxiety and other such go up more than it ever does.'</p>

    <p>    For instance, give me a clear indication of what questions might be asked so that I can prepare: my mind is sometimes either a filing cabinet that uses the dewey decimal system or I immediately know what to say because it's such a common question that my answer is primed, locked and loaded. </p>
    <p> The most common question, is simulataneously the hardest question, I enjoy playing a vast numbers of games; there are games that I love purely for the aesthetics, games that I love purely for the stories and games that I love purely based on its mechanics and gameplay.</p>
    <p> When this question is asked&#8212;It truly takes a moment.</p>

    <uL>
      <li>For the Aesthetics / The Game is a vibe: Afterparty by Night School Studios (ngl, I brought it purely because of the music and art&#8212;then I got the soundtrack on Vinyl), Ruiner, Hunt: Showdown by Crytek, Marathon: Durandal, NFS: Unbound, Watch Dogs: 2, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, Manhunt   </li>
      <li>For the Narrative: Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, A Plague Tale: Innocence, Final Fantasy X, Mass Effect, Baldur's Gate 3, I Was A Teenage Exocolonist, Control by Rememdy, Clive Barker's Jericho, The Evil Within 1 & 2, Medal of Honor: Frontlines, Area 51, Murdered: Soul Suspect, Sleeping Dogs   </li>
      <li>For the Gameplay & Mechanics: State of Decay by Undead Labs, Bully by Rockstar, Prey (2016) by Arkane Studios, Frostpunk, Naruto: Rise of a Ninja, Ready Or Not, Jet Set Radio, X-Com, Duskers , Project Zomboid </li>
    
      <br>
      <p>Special Interest Games: These are the games that I have a increasingly dumb amount of hours on and have attempted to mod it to some extent.</p>
      <li>Special Interest Games: The Sims 4, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Elite: Dangerous, Overlord II, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 and Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, Resident Evil: Outbreak File #1 & #2,  </li>

<p> Other honorable mention games: SCUM, RimWorld, Fallout: New Vegas, Skyrim, Phasmophobia, Obey Me! Shall We Date, Dante's Inferno, Void Bastards, Stardew Valley, Sniper Elite 4, Postal 2, Typing of the Dead: Overkill, Kingdom Come: Deliverance
    </ul>


  <p>I have a tendacy to hyperfocus on a problem and I like to know the reason scour everything about why something works because it will allow me to figure out other possible solutions. I've been channeling my tendancies to hyperfocus from a challenge into an advantage in a professional setting. Which may cause me to lose track of time, but the end result, is work it. Due to this, even on my odd-seeming portfolio, I've done a deep-dive in Game Design: finding my areas of enjoyment to be systeming, balancing and the more data-centric parts of it. With that in mind, when that happens: the best thing you can ask is, what did you discover?</p>
  
  <p>Even more so, now with ChatGPT being a thing. I write in a way that may make it seem like it's written using ChatGPT, though it's mostly because due to my neurodivergency: I'll tell a fun-fact about myself, I was reading at a college lexile level when I was in third grade. That got me in trouble because of the subject matter of what I read as a third grader in Elementary School. I've always enjoyed writing and I'm rather enthused by using big words from time-to-time as it comes neutral and well, I'm a bit of a romantic when it comes to floral descriptions.'</p>

  <p>On another note, I have an auditory proccessing delay as it's apart of ADHD. My preferred method of communication is writing but with preparation I'm perfectly fine speaking. Why would I mention this? It takes a moment from my brain to translates the word to say the correct thing, I already have an intended topic or point to make. And if you are an possible employer, bring this up: I do have quite the experience to mention about this&#8212; if you care about embracing neurodivergency.</p>

  <p>Optimal Working Environments <br><em>I'm looking for the right fit, not just a good fit.</em> <br>Due to my ADHD and lived professional experiences, I've found that I thrive in smaller group settings where there are fewer participants and more opportunities to engage and participate. I work best in a setting that alloqa for cosued and interactive discussions. Due to my auditory processing delay, these specific settings allow for me to actively listen, process information, and contribute meaningfully. I am aware that it's a personally challenge&#8212; so that's why I'm updfront about it.</p>

    <h4>Accomodations</h4>
  <p>So, then what that in mind, What exactly keeps me energized when working and lowers the risk of burning out?</p>
    <ul>
        <p>Perfect Accomodation seems like: Most Energized</p>
        <li>Small to medium-sized team that I mainly work with, fridays are off unless otherwise needed to allow for appointments. I am able to mentor someone once I'm perfectly up to speed with how the process works. Focus time for researching and strategizing. Working fully remotely, with the ability to go into the office occassionally as I wish.</li>
        <p>Providing meeting agendas in advance, giving written summaries and implementing breaks during longer meetings will help me retain my focus.</p>
      </ul>
    <p> Bad Accomodation is simply no accomodation. </p>
