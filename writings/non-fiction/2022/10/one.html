<h2>Game Data Analysis</h2>

<h4 class="dateline">October 2022</h4>

<div id="post">

  <p>It's now spooky month! Ever been to a corn-maze? I have-- what I noticed is that no one really knows what to do: if you were to take some data, you'd likely find out that: </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Some people go to scare their friends in different ways.</li>
      <li>Some people just don't know what they are doing in the maze.</li>
      <li>Some people get bored, and just don't see the appeal.</li>
      <li>Some people get a thrill from being lost inside a field of corn.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Et cetera. But what about when it comes to data in video games? Fetching metrics and seeking questions is how to make the best of what game you are developing, it helps with fine-tuning the rules. I'm going to use one of my projects as an example: Void Installer.</p>
  <p>Outside of metrics with players: I created an excel spreadsheet and decided to find out on average, how much game currency in one game session does a player earn per click? When I found that I, I used that as a fulcrum to decide what to set prices on in the in-game shops. But-- there is more stats going on in the background. I have to account for system integrity (which damage is halted by buying shields) and the players hunger levels (which is halted by ording from the in-game shop). I then used the average money earned to decide on how to make buying items a meaningful decision, and then how will randomness effect the game. It's not pure randomness and sometimes the meaningful decisions won't always be meaningful and that's fine. This is where getting the data
  changes.
  </p>
  <p>        Playtesting. </p> 
  <p>I'll admit myself. I sometimes forget to playtest with actual players, but regardless, when I do: the data that they give is extremely helpful and things we, as designers, don't really think about it. It's a culmination of user experience testing, benchmarking, and hitting the spreadsheets again. The first playtest with Void Installer, I was given a great many inquires:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What is the point of the game?</li>
            <li>How do I know what all I'm supposed to do?</li>
            <li>Can you make the UI better?</li>
            <li>Are you going to improve the art some more?</li>
            <li>What other features are you going to add?</li>
          </ul>
  <p>I then put these in a Trello and made it into a list; a lot to tackle, but to break it down. First was the part of the game. I examined what I felt was the point of the game and then crafted it into a story. I figured if I tell a story, it will make- okay, I digress. Not the point of this topic. Game Data isn't just purely numbers, but it's a large part. I rarely see a game data analyst as a job position title. Which makes me wonder if it's more or less seen as purely a QA thing. A game data analyst isn't just QA though: they can slice and impart details that is helpful to game designers in a way that makes sense even to the common laymen. An game analyst is able to give the game designers specific details that can help in other areas.</p>
  <p>The data that I was able to gain has made the latest iteration of Void Installer something interesting. It's a side project that I hope to keep iterating. Which will always require data- for myself to make meaningful decisions on how to craft: fun, or a decent experience.</p>
  <p>Data is many things. We live in a tech, emotional and data driven world. The least we can do is use it in a way that benefits us all.</p>
