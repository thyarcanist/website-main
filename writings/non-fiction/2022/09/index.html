  <p>Foreword: I'm a game designer first and foremost, my most feverent belief is in Transhumanism, not in the aspect of immortality. More in the realm of using science and technology to further the lifes of people. In truth, we can't just expect people to look past old ideas and suddenly adopt these new technologies. That would be ignoring a very real and natural part of the human condition. The fear of the unknown-- the love of tradition. </p>
  
  <p>What is being created is usually for entertainment or accessibility purposes. These are generally medical or functional art. The question is when will these be affordable (though not cheap, or poorly made) and available to the general public at large? That's the moment when these technologies will become game changers.</p>

  <p>Now let's look at some current emerging and in development technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A real life Heads-Up Display(HUD) that's a content lens, created by <a href="https://www.mojo.vision">Mojo Vision</a>.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.teslasuit.io">Teslasuit</a>, a full bodysuit that captures biometric, motion and provides haptic feedback.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gropyus.com/">Gropyus</a>, a German company that seeks to create sustainable, affordable smart housing that has integrated solar panels.</li>
      </ul>

  <p>Onto the gastronomy companies at play such as:<a href="https://soylent.com/"> Soylent</a>. Don't worry, it's not made of people. It's developed by what they call their product: Soylent. The very geeky, meal cubes created by <a href="https://getmeepo.com/">Meepo</a>. The plant-based meat substitutes are also coming along well. I wonder if some of these take into account dietary concerns such as hypothyroidism when creating these experimental foods. Usually, these alternatives are made using soy-based products which affects medicine used to balance thyroid issues albeit that's remedied by intaking iodine.</p>
